An example of this can be with team6 activity. Ricky and I struggle to understand the `POST` request and how to use is correctly. I personally like to use AI to help me learn things, although I have found that it is not alway reliable, so I end up using other websites like stackoverflow or w3schools.

I enjoy working as teams, during this class I was able to work with Ricky and we were able to acomplish a lot of learning together. I felt like I learned a lot of usefull techniques from him and I hope he did from me too. We meet everyweek outside of class to make sure we finish our team activities.

using a divide and conquer approach to design solutions for programming problems,
Student spends adequate time in planning their projects before they start coding.
Student is adept in taking a complex problem and breaking it down into small trivial steps

### Rating: 2/4

I still struggle with this part, not because the lack of knowledge but perhaps lack of proper tactics. Even today I can get overwelmed by the amount of things I need to do when working on a project, but I feel like I have been trying to put in more effort into using tool like trello or abstraction. There is a lot of room for improvement here.

This is something we usually spend the most time on when it comes to testing our team activities and although we have been better at knowing where to find the bugs I should be better at writing test code to test a feature.

I feel pretty confident about this. I recently have been working on a lot of project that involve object-oriented programming, correct use of data structures and better code organization. Some examples are:
- [Card game using Python](https://github.com/Elchamos64/Team3.14_card_game/tree/developer_branch)
- [Portfolio using react](https://github.com/Elchamos64/portfolio)
